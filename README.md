# JavaDoc That Rocks

Welcome! This project probably won't cover everything, but it will cover a lot of the basics.

This project covers [**JDK 14**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/).

I'm a huge [UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/ "Unified Modeling Language") nerd. so there will be a lot of diagrams in this project generated with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). Those files will be stored in the assets directory.

In addition to Java SE and JDK, we'll also touch a few other libraries:
* [**JUnit**](https://junit.org/junit5/) ([github](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/)) for unit testing and test-driven development
* [**Spring**](https://spring.io/) ([github](https://github.com/spring-projects)) - <abbr title="Model-View-Control">MVC</abbr> Framework that can be reactive.
* [**Apache Commons**](https://commons.apache.org/) ([github](https://github.com/apache?q=commons&type=&language=)) - <abbr title="Comma-Separated Value">CSV</abbr> support, among other things.
* [**JavaFX**](https://openjfx.io/) ([github](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx)) - A software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications as well as <abbr title="Rich Internet Applications">RIAs</abbr> that can run across a wide variety of devices.

## Possible Future Plans
* [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Used for [Android Development](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
* [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [**Gradle**](https://gradle.org/) ([github](https://github.com/gradle/gradle)) - Build Tool used by [Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html), and Android Development ([Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html)).
* [**JRuby**](https://www.jruby.org/) - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) on the JVM.
* Whatever game engine is popular with Java. (Still deciding what's good since we don't have Unity.)

## FAQ

### Why Oracle Java instead of OpenJDK?
As much as I support Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), I'm more comfortable with using Oracle Java instead of OpenJDK.

### What happened to Java Swing?
JavaFX is the new Java Swing. Swing's been gone for over a decade.

### What's the best IDE for Java Development?
JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. I'm using the community edition and it's awesome. Imagine what the full version is like!
